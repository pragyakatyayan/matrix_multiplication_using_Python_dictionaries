# Matrix Multiplication using Python Dictionaries

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-v3.7-orange" alt="Python3.7">

This program was built just to experiment with Python Dictionaries and perform Matrix Multiplications between two matrices of any dimensions*. 
It visualizes input and output matrices in simplest form. The code has no dependencies and takes all inputs from users, from dimensions of input matrices to all its elements.


(\* number of rows of second input matrix is by default equal to the number of columns of first input matrix.)
